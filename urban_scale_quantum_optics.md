# Urban-Scale Quantum Optical Network Architecture
**Integrating Love-OS (PSF-Zero) with Quantum Kuramoto Dynamics for Long-Distance Phase-Locking**

## 1. Overview & The Topological Bottleneck
In urban-scale quantum networks (e.g., linking NV centers or superconducting nodes via 100km+ optical fibers), maintaining optical phase synchronization is the primary physical bottleneck. Environmental friction—thermal drift, mechanical vibrations, and acoustic noise—creates severe phase damping ($T_\phi$). 

Classical Phase-Locked Loops (PLLs) handle this poorly. When the phase error exceeds the linear tracking regime, the PLL experiences a mathematical singularity (cycle-slip), violently losing lock. By applying the **Love-OS geometric head (PSF-Zero)**—specifically Stereographic Projective Regularization (`/0`) and Exponential Information Tracking (`EIT`) on the $S^1$ fiber—we geometrically absorb these spikes, maintaining macroscopic synchronization ($r \ge 0.5$) where classical systems fail.

## 2. Hardware Architecture & TDM Pilot
* **Wavelength:** L-band (low-loss, validated for 10h+ stable urban operation).
* **Pilot Signal:** A weak coherent pulse ($\sim 6.5 \times 10^5$ photons/s) is multiplexed (TDM at 50% duty cycle) with the quantum payload on the same fiber. 
* **Detection:** Displacement-enhanced photon counting at the quadrature point to estimate the phase error $\phi(t)$.

## 3. Mathematical Mapping (The Kuramoto Translation)
We map the physical PLL dynamics onto a delayed stochastic Kuramoto model to generate a strict survival boundary (Phase Map):
* **$K$ (Coupling Strength):** Equivalent to loop gain / phase update angle per sample.
* **$\sigma_\phi$ (Noise):** RMS phase noise derived from the integrated Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the fiber (typically 1–50 kHz band).
* **$\tau$ (Delay):** Round-trip transit time of the fiber. Crucial for determining subcritical/supercritical bifurcations in delayed Kuramoto models.

## 4. The PSF-Zero Optical Filter (Core Logic)
Insert this lightweight geometric filter immediately after the interferometer's instantaneous phase measurement $\phi_{meas}$ and before the actuator.

```python
import numpy as np

class PSFZeroPhase:
    def __init__(self, lam=0.12, sigma=np.deg2rad(45)):
        self.lam = lam        # EIT Forgetting factor
        self.sigma = sigma    # Projective Saturation constant
        self.zbar = 1 + 0j    # S1 internal state

    def clamp(self, dphi):
        # /0 Projective Regularization: Smoothly saturates infinite spikes
        return dphi / np.sqrt(self.sigma**2 + dphi**2)

    def update(self, phi_meas):
        # 1. Exponential Information Tracking on S1
        self.zbar = (1 - self.lam) * self.zbar + self.lam * np.exp(1j * phi_meas)
        phi_smooth = np.angle(self.zbar)
        
        # 2. Extract drift and apply /0 geometric clamp
        dphi = (phi_meas - phi_smooth + np.pi) % (2*np.pi) - np.pi
        return self.clamp(dphi)
```
## 5. Deployment & Tooling

To validate this architecture on your own physical links, we provide two scripts in this repository:

1.[psd_to_rms_phase.py](https://github.com/love-os-architect/README/blob/main/psd_to_rms_phase.py)　: Converts raw interferometer telemetry (time-series CSV) into a rigorously integrated RMS phase noise $\sigma_\phi$ (1-50kHz).
2. [kuramoto_phase_map.py](https://github.com/love-os-architect/README/blob/main/kuramoto_phase_map.py)　: Simulates the stochastic Kuramoto delay differential equations to generate a 2D survival boundary Phase Map ($K$ vs. $\sigma_\phi$), acting as a "ruler" for stable loop design.
