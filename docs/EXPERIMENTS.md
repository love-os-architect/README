## Empirical Validation Protocol: E1 (The Planetary Coupling Test)

**Objective:** To falsify the hypothesis that the Imaginary Axis ($iy$) Resonance is coupled to a universal/planetary driver ($\Gamma_{ext}$), effectively proving that Phase Synchronization ($r$) increases when Ego Resistance ($R_{eff}$) is dropped under natural conditions.

**Methodology (Within-Subject Crossover Design):**
1. **Subjects:** 10+ dyads (pairs) engaging in the `/phase-shift` and `inductive-dialogue` protocols.
2. **Conditions:** - *Condition A (Natural Field):* Conducted outdoors (e.g., agricultural field / Hieri cultivation zone) with natural geomagnetic exposure.
   - *Condition B (Shielded):* Conducted in a Faraday-shielded room.
3. **Proxy Metrics (Sensors):**
   - $R^*$ (Effective Resistance): Calculated via wearable HRV (Heart Rate Variability), EDA (Electrodermal Activity), and response latency.
   - $r(t)$ (Phase Coherence): Calculated via speech prosody cross-correlation and latency mirroring.

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- **Success (Model Validated):** As subjects consciously increase Receptivity ($A$) via the breathing/anchoring protocols, $R^*$ decreases and $r(t)$ spikes. Furthermore, Condition A (Outdoors) yields a statistically significantly faster phase-lock ($dt_{sync}$) than Condition B, proving the presence of $\Gamma_{ext}$.
- **Falsification (Model Rejected):** If $R^*$ approaches $0$ but $r(t)$ remains random, or if no difference exists between natural and shielded environments, the Love-OS physical isomorphism must be re-evaluated.
